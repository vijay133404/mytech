            <p>Avoid the annoying advertisements and restrictions that accompany free e-mail systems! 
            Use the POP3 feature to manage your e-mail service with commonly-used e-mail programs like Microsoft Outlook®, Outlook® Express, Eudora®, Netscape®, and others.</p> 
            <p>Create aliases that allow you to use addresses for special or short-term uses, such as info@yourdomain.com, or sales@yourdomain.com.</p> 
            <p>Protect your business from spam with the included industry-leading Anti-Spam filter. When mass unsolicited e-mails are sent, they are detected almost instantly by the network and intercepted before they reach your inbox! </p>
