This is the ONE single area in which everything "should" tie together.  The Order entry systems, Inventory, Sales Automation, Customer contact, Website, HR and etc. If the infrastructure is weak then it could cause a cascading effect on the other systems that may depend on the other. Veteran IT solution providers understand this but some of the un-seasoned consultants and business owners just see an infrastructure as something they need to perform a break-fix solution on
                </p>
                <p>Continual Service Improvement or (CSI) has a large role in keeping the infrastructure in top condition in order to allow all of the services and applications flow effectively.  Each service available to end users should be re-evaluated annually unless one of these services are experiencing a performance hit which is most likely due to poor assessment from the year before.</p>

                  <h2>Continual Service Improvement (CSI)</h2>
                  <p>Aligning and realigning IT services to changing business needs (because stand still implies decline).</p>
                  <p>The goal of Continual Service Improvement is to align and realign IT Services to changing business needs by identifying and implementing improvements to the IT services that support the Business Processes. The perspective of CSI on improvement is the business perspective of service quality, even though CSI aims to improve process effectiveness, efficiency and cost effectiveness of the IT processes through the whole lifecycle. In order to manage improvement, CSI should clearly define what should be controlled and measured.</p>
                  <p>CSI needs to be treated just like any other service practice. There needs to be upfront planning, training and awareness, ongoing scheduling, roles created, ownership assigned, and activities identified in order to be successful. CSI must be planned and scheduled as process with defined activities, inputs, outputs, roles and reporting.</p>
