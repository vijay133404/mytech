Image is everything for a company.</p> 
			<p>
			Graphic design breathes life into the images that form your companyâ€™s brand. Trying to come up with a strong brand image? Graphic design can help you do just that- create a lasting impression with your target audience that combines ideas, imagery and text.
			</p>
			<p>
			For new businesses looking to establish themselves, graphic design is critical in that it helps you to communicate your brand (whether product or service) to your customer base. With graphic design, you can differentiate your firm from your competition, while expanding your companyâ€™s visibility and awareness with your target market. 
			</p>
			<p>
			For more tenured companies, graphic design is also an important component of branding. Often, companies add product lines or services, or enter into new markets altogether. Effective graphic design helps your firm establish a brand identity with new markets, or with the announcement of new products and services. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Think about the importance of graphic design in building your business. Your companyâ€™s website, logo, packaging, paper and electronic communication, business cards, brochures, invoicing, among others, all reflect- or should- your companyâ€™s brand. Graphic design helps build the brand. Strong branding leads to more sales, deeper relationships with clients, profitability and long-term sustainability.
